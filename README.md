# Spam SMS Detection Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to detect spam SMS messages. Spam SMS messages are unsolicited and often contain deceptive or malicious content. Detecting such messages is crucial for protecting users from phishing attacks, scams, and unwanted solicitations.

## Features

- Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of SMS messages.
- Implements a variety of machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Provides preprocessing steps to clean and transform raw SMS data.
- Offers evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the raw SMS data.
2. **Model Training**: Train the spam SMS detection model using various machine learning algorithms.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics.
4. **Inference**: Use the trained model to predict whether new SMS messages are spam or not.

## Dataset

- Utilizes publicly available SMS datasets for training and testing purposes.
- The dataset contains labeled examples of both spam and non-spam SMS messages.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
